    remember to be a little lenient and check also with a few status below too if that matches (if user says 70 , check with 40 too) because users can put in a little more than usual sometimes.
    so for this project in the picture has been reported to be at {project_status}% what is your verification status (only one single digit is allowed as your output no text description at any cost)
